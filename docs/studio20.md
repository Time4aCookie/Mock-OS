1. When a client calls the destructor of the passwordProxy, what they are really saying is they want to delete the actual file object associated with this proxy. Because of this, we want to delete the member variable associate with this abstract file. In addition, if we don't do this, then when the proxy is deleted, there will be no way for the client to access the pointer to the file, and this would result in a memory leak.
2. We dynamically allocated an abstractFile and made a passwordProxy to refer to this file if the user entered the password that we provided in the parameter. Then we tested all of the methods that we previously called on the abstractFile on the passwordProxy file instead. We observed prompts to enter the password in the terminal for both the read and write functions.
3. We failed one test because we called getName and getSize on the "this" object of the class instead of the abstractFile class, which caused infinite loops and an exception to be thrown.
